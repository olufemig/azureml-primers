# Exercise 6: Deploying a Model into Production

## Before You Start

Before you start this exercise, ensure that you have completed the [previous execise](ex5.md).

## Task 1: Deploy a Model as a Web Service

Now that you have an optimal model, it's time to deploy it as a web service so that it can be used in an application.

1. Start your Notebook VM and connect to **Jupyter** or **JupyterLab**.
2. In the **/azureml-primers/notebooks** folder, open the **06 - Deploying a Model into Production.ipynb** notebook.
3. Read the notes in the notebook, running each code cell in turn.

> **Note**: If you intend to continue straight to the [next exercise](ex7.md), leave your Notebook VM running. If you're taking a break, you might want to close the Jupyter tabs and **Stop** your Notebook VM to avoid incurring unnecessary costs.
