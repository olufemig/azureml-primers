This is the first in a series of hands-on exercises that are designed to introduce the core concepts and components on an Azure ML solution. These exercises assume an existing knowledge of Python and general machine learning concepts and frameworks. Each exercise is provided in its own notebook - it is assumed that you will complete the exercises in order.\n\nBefore you can start the exercises, you will need a Microsoft Azure subscription. This is different from the free *Azure Notebooks* account you created to use this notebook. If you do not already have an Azure subscription, you can sign up for a free trial at https://azure.microsoft.com/free/.\n\nIn a separate browser tab, sign into your Azure subscription and view your portal at https://portal.azure.com. As you proceed through the tasks below, you'll toggle between this notebook and the portal to visually confirm that the code you've run here has had the intended results in your Azure subscription.\n\n## Task 1: Install the Azure ML SDK for Python\n\nThe Azure ML SDK for Python provides classes you can use to work with Azure ML in your Azure subscription. The SDK is pre-installed in the Azure Notebooks environment, but it's worth checking that you have the latest version of the package installed. Run the cell below to install the **azureml-sdk** Python package, including the optional *notebooks* component; which provides some functionality specific to the Jupyter Notebooks environment.\n\n> **More Information**: For more details about installing the Azure ML SDK and its optional components, see the [Azure ML SDK Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/overview/azure/ml/install?view=azure-ml-py)"

To create this authenticated connection, you can use the **authentication** module in the Azure ML SDK. In this case, you'll use the **InteractiveLoginAuthentication** class to generate a session token.\n\nRun the cell below, and when prompted, click the https://microsoft.com/devicelogin link and enter the automatically generated code. Then, sign into your Azure subscription in the browser tab that is opened. After you have successfully signed in, you can close the browser tab that was opened and return to this notebook."

As its name suggests, a workspace is a centralized place to manage all of the Azure ML resources you need to work on a machine learning project.\n\n> **More Information**: To learn more about workspaces, see the [Azure ML Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/concept-workspace).\n\nYou can create a workspace using the visual interface in the Azure portal, but in this exercise you'll use the Azure ML SDK to create the workspace using code. This approach makes it easier to keep a record of the steps used to provision your Azure ML environment, and enables you to automate the steps should you need to recreate things later.\n\nIn the code below, enter appropriate values for the *SUBSCRIPTION_ID*, *RESOURCE_GROUP*, *WORKSPACE_NAME*, and *REGION* constants (you can find your Azure subscription ID in the Azure portal - just click the &#128273; **Subscriptions** tab on the left and then select the subscription you want to use). Then run the cell to create your workspace.\n\n> **Note**: If you hadn't previously created an authenticated session, you'd automatically be prompted to sign into your Azure subscription!"

Well, there are lots of benefits, which we'll explore in detail in later exercises; but for now, let's see how Azure ML can help track metrics from a simple experiment that uses Python code to examine some data.\n\nIn this case, you'll use a simple dataset that contains details of patients that have been tested for diabetes. You'll run an experiment to explore the data, extracting statistics, visualizations, and data samples. Most of the code you'll use is fairly generic Python, such as you might run in any data exploration process. However, with the addition of a few lines, the code uses an Azure ML *experiment* to log details of the run."

This enables you to track multiple runs of the same experiment so you can observe variations in the metrics produced based on parameters or random data variation.\n\nThe **Experiments** tab in your Azure ML Workspace lists all of the experiments that have been run in the workspace.\n\n> **More Information**: To find out more about running experiments, see [this topic](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/how-to-manage-runs) in the Azure ML documentation.
