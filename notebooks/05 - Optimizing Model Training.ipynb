    "# Exercise 4 - Optimizing Model Training\n",
    "\n",
    "In [the previous exercise](./03%20-%20Compute%20Contexts.ipynb), you created cloud-based compute and used it when running a model training experiment. The benefit of cloud compute is that it offers a cost-effective way to scale out your experiment workflow and try different algorithms and parameters in order to optimize your model's performance; and that's what we'll explore in this exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Important**: This exercise assumes you have completed the previous exercises in this series - specifically, you must have:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> - Created an Azure ML Workspace.\n",
    "> - Uploaded the diabetes.csv data file to the workspace's default datastore.\n",
    "> - Registered a **Diabetes Dataset** dataset in the workspace.\n",
    "> - Provisioned an Azure ML Compute resource named **cpu-cluster**.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> If you haven't done that, now would be a good time - nobody's going to do it for you!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Task 1: Connect to Your Workspace\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing you need to do is to connect to your workspace using the Azure ML SDK. Let's start by ensuring you still have the latest version installed (if you ended and restarted your Azure Notebooks session, the environment may have been reset)"
