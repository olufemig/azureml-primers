Int his exercise, you'll build on that work and deploy a model as a production web service.\n\n> **Important**: This exercise assumes you have completed the previous exercises in this series - specifically, you must have:\n>\n> - Created an Azure ML Workspace.\n> - Uploaded the diabetes.csv data file to the workspace's default datastore.\n> - Registered a **Diabetes Dataset** dataset in the workspace.\n> - Trained and registered at least one **diabetes_model** model in the workspace.\n>\n> If you haven't done that, what are you waiting for?\n\n## Task 1: Connect to Your Workspace\n\nThe first thing you need to do is to connect to your workspace using the Azure ML SDK. Let's start by ensuring you still have the latest version installed (if you ended and restarted your Azure Notebooks session, the environment may have been reset)"
