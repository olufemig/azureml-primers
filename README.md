# Azure Machine Learning Primers

This repo contains some hands-on exercises to get you started with Azure Machine Learning (*Azure ML*). You should complete the exercises in order.

## Assumed Knowledge

These exercises are designed to help data scientists learn how to use Azure ML to run data science workloads in the cloud. They are ***not*** designed to teach Python or machine learning concepts. If you are a data scientist or other software professional, and you are familiar with the following, then these exercises are for you:

- Python environments and package management (including *conda* and *pip*)
- Common Python libraries for data analysis (including *numpy*, *pandas*, and *matplotlib*)
- Machine Learning on Python (including a basic conceptual understanding of machine learning principles, and common ML frameworks - particularly *scikit-learn*)

## Exercises
